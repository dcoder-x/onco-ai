        AI Profile is where you capture all of your unique preferences for gathering information so the AI can remember
        them and use that information to give you results that fit you best.
        There’s no need to repeat yourself in each search query. What should I
        include in the AI profile? You can include details that help OncoAI
        personalize your experience, such as age, location, interests, values &
        beliefs, search response format, preferred language, or even dietary
        needs. For instance, if you enjoy science and speak English, the AI will
        tailor the responses accordingly. Remember, share only what makes you
        feel comfortable, as we prioritize your privacy. Do I need to be a
        Subscriber for my AI Profile criteria to be applied to search results?
        Not at all! Your AI Profile will enhance your search results in Search
        too. However, Subscription does have the advantage of clarifying your
        queries for even better results.
